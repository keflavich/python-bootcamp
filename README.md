Astronomy Python Bootcamp at the University of Florida
======================================================

Here are found Jupyter notebooks for the Python bootcamp for AST 3722, which is
based off a course run each year for 2nd year undergraduate astronomy students
at the University of Sheffield. 

These notebooks can be viewed statically online  [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/keflavich/python-bootcamp/tree/master/).

Alternatively, if you would like to download and run the notebooks
interactively, you can do that. They are intended to be executed
with Jupyter 4 or newer. You can find installation instructions
[here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).

The notebooks and associated data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/keflavich/python-bootcamp/zipball/master).
Unzip the notebooks:

```
unzip python-bootcamp.zip
```

and start the IPython (Jupyter and IPython are the same thing) notebook in the resulting directory.

```
jupyter notebook
```
